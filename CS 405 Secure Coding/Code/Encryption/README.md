The Encryption.cpp file contains a C++ program that demonstrates a symmetric data transformation process using a bitwise XOR operation. The core of the application is the encrypt_decrypt function, which accepts a source string and a key, performing a character-by-character transformation where the key is applied cyclically via a modulo operation. To ensure robustness and performance, the code utilizes assert statements to validate that both the key and source data are present, and it pre-calculates string lengths to optimize the transformation loop. The main function orchestrates the end-to-end workflow by reading content from a source file, extracting student metadata, executing the encryption to an intermediate file, and finally performing a decryption to verify that the original data can be successfully recovered.
