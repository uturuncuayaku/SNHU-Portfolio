This C++ program serves as a secure implementation of user input handling designed to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The code initializes a fixed-size character array and utilizes a while loop to read input character-by-character from the standard input stream. To ensure memory safety, it explicitly checks the current input length against the buffer size, effectively discarding any excess characters and clearing the input buffer if the limit is exceeded. Once valid input is captured, the program manually appends a null terminator to the string before displaying the result alongside a constant account number, demonstrating a robust approach to managing fixed-length buffers in a secure development context.
