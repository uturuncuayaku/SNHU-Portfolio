The SQLInjection.cpp program demonstrates the risks associated with SQL injection vulnerabilities and the importance of secure database interaction using the SQLite library. By importing sqlite3.h and linking against sqlite3.c, the code establishes an in-memory database to simulate real-world scenarios where user input is used to construct database queries. The program illustrates how unsanitized input can be exploited to bypass authentication or leak sensitive information, while also providing a framework for implementing defensive measures such as input validation and prepared statements. Through its structured flow—including database initialization, the execution of both vulnerable and secure queries, and the use of callback functions to handle results—the code serves as a practical educational tool for identifying and mitigating common web security flaws within a C++ environment.
