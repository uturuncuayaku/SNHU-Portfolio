The Green Pace Secure Development Policy is a comprehensive framework designed to embed security into the software development lifecycle, specifically focusing on C/C++ and Java applications.
 
This document establishes ten core security principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege and mandates ten specific C/C++ coding standards to mitigate risks like memory corruption and injection vulnerabilities. 
 
Beyond technical standards, the policy formalizes organizational governance by defining authentication, authorization, and auditing (AAA) protocols, data encryption requirements, and a structured exceptions process overseen by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). By integrating automated detection tools and rigorous risk assessments, the policy ensures that security is a continuous, verifiable part of the development process at Green Pace.
