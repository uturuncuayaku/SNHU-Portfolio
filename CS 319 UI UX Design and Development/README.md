# User Research and Persona Development

## Overview

This milestone focuses on identifying and understanding the target audience for the Healthy Food Scanner mobile application. The goal is to gather insight into real users’ goals, habits, and pain points to inform user-centered design decisions. This phase includes conducting interviews with potential early adopters, describing the app’s primary audience, and developing two representative user personas.

## Research Objectives

- Identify common motivations and challenges users face when shopping for healthy food.
- Understand how users currently evaluate ingredients and nutritional information.
- Validate the usefulness of barcode scanning and ingredient ranking features.
- Capture context and environment in which users will interact with the app.

## Methodology

Interviews were conducted with 3–4 potential users via a combination of in-person and virtual formats. Participants were selected based on their interest in healthy eating, frequent grocery shopping habits, and likelihood of using a mobile app to assist in food purchasing decisions.

Participants included:
- Health-conscious parents
- Busy professionals with dietary goals
- College students seeking convenient healthy options

## Target Audience Summary

The target audience consists of adults aged 25–45 who are actively trying to improve or maintain healthy eating habits for themselves or their families. Most users have smartphones and are familiar with barcode scanning or fitness apps. These users are often pressed for time and value simplicity, clear visuals, and fast feedback when using mobile applications.

## Deliverables

- Interview summaries (kept anonymous)
- Target audience profile
- Two detailed user personas representing key user groups

## Next Steps

Insights from this research will be used to:
- Prioritize app features based on user needs
- Create wireframes that reflect realistic usage scenarios
- Validate UI/UX choices throughout the prototyping phase
