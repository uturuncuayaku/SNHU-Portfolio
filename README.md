[Final Project - Artemis Financial](https://github.com/uturuncuayaku/SNHU-Portfolio/tree/main/CS350%20Artemis%20Financial/ssl-server_student)  
Artemis Financial is seeking my company Global Rain's advice and expertise on how to protect its client data and financial information. After examining the software using the latest Spring Boot framework and Java JDK 22. We have created a secure web application with an appropriate algorithm and web certificate to protect client data and financial information. End goal was to address any security vulnerabilities after deployment of web application.

## CS 300 Data structures Algorithms: Design and Analysis  
[Final Project - ABC University](https://github.com/uturuncuayaku/SNHU-Portfolio/tree/main/Course%20Planner)  

The university (ABCU) is looking for software to help its computer science advisors access course information for students.

[Final Project - DriverPass System](https://github.com/uturuncuayaku/SNHU-Portfolio/tree/main/DriverPass%20System%20Design) 

Design and analyze buisiness requirements for an online learning management system. This system was called DriverPass and was created by the product owner to help the DMV pass more student drivers by providing online training and on the road training with a driving instructor. I took on the role as a developer and highlighted the key aspects of the system to ensure completion by the proposed schedule. This meant creating UML diagrams, participating in group discussions, and communicating technical needs to a non-technical audience. The final proposal was a web app managed by a developer with data aggregation abilities and driving packages that consisted of scheduling a student with a driver and vehicle.

[Final Project - Sprint Retrospective and Review](https://github.com/uturuncuayaku/SNHU-Portfolio/tree/main/Sprint%20Retrospective%20and%20Review) 

For this project I was asked to take the role of Scrum Master and to put together the Sprint Review and Retrospective. I summarized, analyzed and drew conclusions upon the work completed for a fictional company named Chada Tech. Throughout the semester various artifacts were created for this fictitious company transitioning from waterfall to agile. I created a GUI in Java alongside a fictitious team member and was in constant contact with the Product Owner(our teacher) to understand and clarify requirements for a detailed product backlog consisting of user stories.

[The Gaming Room Design Document](https://github.com/uturuncuayaku/SNHU-Portfolio/tree/main/CS230%20Operating%20Systems%20Platforms)  


This project is the culmination of research into various programming tools and hardware to suggest a responsible approach towards the clients required needs. The Gaming Room is a multiplayer, multiteam piece of software that can save game states and have users login to their account or see their own teams progression. It explores multiple facets of cloud computing, analyzes the memory and storage requirements to run the game for the best user experience and most importantly outlines what ways we can make the software better for future upgrades and a detailed account of revisions to further our clients goals.

[Purchase history](https://github.com/uturuncuayaku/SNHU-Portfolio/tree/main/CS210%20Programming%20Languages%20(C%2B%2B%20and%20Java))  

The project, "Corner Grocer: Purchase History of Produce with Frequency Count Using Mappings in C++," involved designing a program to track and display the frequency of produce items in a purchase history. The program allows users to search for specific items and view how often each appears, with the data being organized using mappings. I implemented a file reading system, parsed user input, and introduced a class to store and display search results in a histogram. This project highlights my ability to abstract complex data/user input and organize code efficiently.
