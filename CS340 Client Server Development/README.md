# CS 340: Client/Server Development

Focused on applying database systems concepts and principles, this course emphasized the development of client/server applications that interface client-side code with databases.

### **Course Competencies:**  
- **CS-30433:** Applied database systems concepts and principles in the development of a client/server application  
  * Created a Python module that will create, read, update and delete from a database connection after authorization and connection using Pymongo library.
- **CS-30434:** Created databases designed to interface with client-side applications  
  * Imported database to interact with Jupyter notebook file that connects to the database using my python module.
- **CS-30435:** Developed client-side code capable of interacting with databases
  * Created a Jupyter Notebook Dash client using HTML, and CSS to dynamically create a bar graph of the number of animals and a dynamically generated map of the location of the selected animal from our database to a Search and Rescue animal shelter.

**Project Overview:**  
For my projects in CS 340, I built full client/server applications that demonstrated database integration and front-end to back-end connectivity.
Throughout development, I referenced Mastering Mongo by Packt Publishing to ensure industry-standard database design and client-side interaction principles were correctly applied.

**Tools and Technologies:**  
- Vim 9.1
- Python version 3.9
- MongoDB version 6.8  
- Bash shell scripting  
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
