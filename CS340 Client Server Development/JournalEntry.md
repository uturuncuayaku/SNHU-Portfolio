# CS 340 Module Eight Journal Entry

In this project, I learned how to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using classes that encapsulate attributes as field member variables. Each attribute denotes a characteristic needed to complete a logical unit within the project scope. By ensuring that attributes are associated only with their respective objects, I kept the data safe and relevant. In the context of our project, this approach helped manage animal shelter data that interfaced with a MongoDB database, holding critical information for debugging connection or authorization issues. Queries were safely constructed, ensuring that incorrect input would not break existing logic.

Working this way, especially in the CRUD Python module from Project One that connected the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two, offered clear advantages. It allowed the system to dynamically manipulate filtered data, refreshing the results displayed in the dashboard widgets. This enabled me to create clean layouts and styling that served the data in an easy-to-comprehend user interface. In the future, I could reuse this CRUD module for any database queries by simply passing in the appropriate hostname and password, making it adaptable for various projects.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems with the goal of achieving the highest level of competency for project success. In this case, that meant understanding how to formulate appropriate queries, knowing the types of queries a MongoDB database expects from a Python module using PyMongo, and integrating those concepts into the business use case of our client, Grazioso Salvare. My approach to this project differed from previous assignments in that I needed to learn how to find and apply specific information about database connections and authentications before building a workflow. I focused heavily on understanding authentication protocols, proper connection establishment, and efficient query syntax to meet project requirements.

In the future, I would use techniques such as batch processing for data insertion and create indexes to improve database performance. Additionally, analyzing client usage data could help refine queries and adapt the database schema to ensure reliability and efficiency over the softwareâ€™s lifecycle.

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing efficient, reliable, and adaptable systems. This matters because it directly impacts how businesses operate and make decisions. My work on this type of project would help a company like Grazioso Salvare by providing a reliable and efficient tool to manage and retrieve important animal rescue data, ultimately supporting better operations, decision-making, and client service.
