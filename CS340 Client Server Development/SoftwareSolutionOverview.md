# Grazioso Salvare: Rescue Animal Candidate Identification Dashboard

As the lead developer at Global Rain, a custom software design and development company, I built a full-stack application to assist Grazioso Salvare, an international rescue-animal training organization.  

Grazioso Salvare specializes in identifying and training dogs for search-and-rescue missions, including water rescue, wilderness recovery, disaster response, and scent tracking. To support their efforts, they partnered with a non-profit agency managing five animal shelters around Austin, Texas, providing a steady stream of candidate data.

This repository contains a complete solution designed to streamline Grazioso Salvare’s selection process.  
Key components of the project include:
- A MongoDB database to store and organize shelter animal data.
- A Python module enabling secure Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
- A user-friendly, client-facing web dashboard that allows non-technical users to filter, categorize, and identify suitable dogs for specialized training programs.

The dashboard was built with a strong emphasis on usability to reduce user error and minimize the need for training. All code is open source and designed for adaptability, allowing Grazioso Salvare — or similar organizations — to customize the system for future needs.

Documentation and full setup instructions are included in the project’s README to ensure reproducibility and ease of deployment.
