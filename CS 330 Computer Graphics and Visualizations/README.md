## Design skills and process
Designing software effectively requires an understanding of foundational programming principles. A software engineer must be familiar with variable types, custom data structures, and efficient ways to store and manipulate data. This understanding leads to well-commented, modular code that improves maintainability.

In our final project, I found that working with a state machine—such as in the OpenGL library—was a valuable design skill. Additionally, recognizing the importance of specific imports streamlined our development process.

Using data types that store multiple float values, such as vec3, allows for intuitive color representation (red, green, and blue). This abstraction reduces complexity, making the code more readable and freeing developers to focus on crafting a visually compelling and lifelike scene.

For my game's design process, I started by setting a clear goal: to create a vivid and realistic scene. This led me to focus on the proportions of objects, ensuring they closely resembled their real-world counterparts. However, I also took creative liberties, particularly with a large dinosaur, which served as my software "rubber ducky."

## Design Approach 
My design approach can be applied to future projects by following a structured workflow. First, I would create a list of actionable tasks and prioritize them. Then, by researching the topic and leveraging my existing knowledge, I can generate new ideas that drive progress. Achieving small milestones along the way ensures steady progress toward my final goal.

While developing progams, I start by defining a clear goal and breaking the project into manageable tasks. Apart from the previous techniques, the objects had lighting techniques, and textures applied. This provided my scene with realistic objects within the 3D scene. I experimented with shading techniques and light sources to enhance this realism. 

Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and technical expertise that are essential for achieving my goals. It enables me to build efficient software, optimize processes, My approach to developing code evolved throughout my project's milestones by seperating the objects into seperate functions and testing to ensure it worked as intended. Computational graphics and visualizations will help me within my career by providing a stepping stone towards making my own video games or creating code to integrate within a larger project. In my future educational pathway I can understand mathematics, physics, and other programming concepts. Object transformations, lighting models, and shader programming can improve my ability to think spatially and logically. And then these skills can be transferred to other educational fields within computer science such as AI-driving visualizations, that are valuable to my education.

In a professional setting, computational graphics help develop technical proficiency in areas such as game design, virtual reality, and simulation. Learning to optimize rendering techniques and manage graphical data structures strengthens my problem solving and efficiency in software engineering roles. Additionally, visualizations ad in data representation, making complex information more accessible across industries like cybersecurity, scientific computing, and UI/UX design.
