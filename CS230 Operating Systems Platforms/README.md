# A software Design recommendation document  

The Gaming Room client required the deployment of an existing app to a cloud-based server, allowing concurrent users and teams to save their game states. 

The game, Draw it or Lose it, is multiplayer and demands ultra-responsive performance, where teams take turns guessing what a displayed picture depicts. A key achievement in this project was translating the multiple requirements into a cohesive, uniform business flow, illustrating a deep understanding of the technical aspects necessary for successful deployment to game clients. By leveraging rapidly deployable Java code and Dropwizard configurations, we were able to test different cloud solutions before selecting the best option. Several platforms were evaluated, addressing critical security considerations such as authentication and the integration of secure, widely-used libraries like Dropwizard.

I successfully structured the libraries to interface with the existing code, ensuring a smooth transition to the cloud and enhancing the user experience. One area of improvement would be to fully implement the game functionality in the future. By prioritizing the clientâ€™s needs and focusing on scalability, the design anticipates changes and ensures a reliable codebase for both current players and future developers. This forward-thinking approach promotes adaptability, responsibility, and long-term business success.
