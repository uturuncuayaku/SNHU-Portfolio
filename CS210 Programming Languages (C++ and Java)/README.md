## Journal
The project I am showcasing is the final assignment from my Computer Science class (CS 210) at Southern New Hampshire University, titled "Corner Grocer: Purchase History of Produce with Frequency Count Using Mappings in C++."

In this project, I designed a program that allows users to search for specific produce items and view how frequently each item appears in the purchase history. One aspect I executed particularly well was abstracting the complexity of individual code components to meet the project specifications. I understood the need to open and read from a file using a filestream and to parse the input effectively. This process became the engine of my program, running a while loop to determine the menu option selected by the user. The most challenging aspect was figuring out how to create and manage a mapping of produce items. I eventually adopted a method similar to logging commands during program debugging, which helped me organize the data efficiently.

I overcame this challenge by introducing a new class toward the end of the project. This class enabled me to store produce items in a vector when searched by the user and later display them in a histogram format. While this wasn't particularly difficult, it required further abstraction to streamline the program’s logic. I referred to the Zybook notes for guidance on more complex code areas, which significantly lengthened the development process due to the multiple submodules involved. Looking back, I believe the program could be made more secure and efficient by analyzing the data flow more thoroughly and decoupling certain elements from the main menu for improved future functionality.

The skills I developed in my previous Python project—a 1-D map game with rooms stored in a list within a dictionary—were instrumental in my success in this class. That experience taught me how to structure and organize my code effectively. I made an effort to enhance readability by giving clear, descriptive names to functions and variables, and I abstracted complex logic into separate functions when necessary, such as when handling user input in a switch statement. Additionally, I ensured the program was adaptable by employing various classes, which allowed for flexibility in creating objects and importing modules as needed. This approach helped me navigate the challenges I faced and provided a clear roadmap to project completion.
