# CS 250 Final Project
Interpreting the user needs and gathering requirements for the completion of our
SNHU Travel Site required interview people that have used the service before and
want to contribute their expertise and insight into how the site should be run.
This allows our team of agile developers to create user stories alongside the
product owner, to complete the site. This allowed us to identify where our
efforts should be concentrated. Having and creating the backlog from user
stories enabled us to ship and test features essential to client happiness.

When approaching a development product you need to have a clear goal and set of
features you are willing to invest in to make a successful project. Without
clear goals certain features imperative to the continued success of our client
wouldn't be possible and would decrease moral and cause a strain to financial
budgets and employee morale.

I believe that to be a great a developer you must be an amazing team player. A
team player that is capable of compassion, empathy, and sincerity when dealing
with your colleagues because there is a lot of pressure to perform well and for
extended periods of time to accomplish our goals. Being aware that differing
levels of expertise and leveraging your co-workers strengths enables a software
development team to be performing its best.
