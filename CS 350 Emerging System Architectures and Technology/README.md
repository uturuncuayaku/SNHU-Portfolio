# CS 350 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The first milestone started with understanding how embedded devices work at a low level. The bread board connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO interface was the first step for our first milestone alongside an LED light that is controlled through pulse width modulation software. Python allowed us to abstract the electrical impulses so that we could focus on dimming and smoothly lighting up the LED. This project specifically pushed us as students to understand what is happening directly without placing our device in danger due to voltage configurations because of our interface drivers talking to the linux kernel. 
Our final project effectively used this base knowledge throughout the semester while elaborating the work done in the first milestone. From turning on an LED to connecting a display and working with serial ports and protocols we built a thermostat for a modern smart home wireless embedded device. We integrated three buttons connected to power with resistors and jumper cables plus connecting the transmit and receive channels from the GPIO interface to our Raspberry Pi to demonstrate the ability of serial communication for our LCD screen updates. Our temperature sensor was also connected to the GPIO interface updating the screen showing the power of the python libraries in developing our features for a full prototype for a ficticious company.

What did you do particularly well?
The ares that I thought I've performed well in is programming in python and learning how libraries are imported and objects are created to create a simple program capable of extraordinary tasks that would have been more verbose in a programming language such as the C language.

Where could you improve?
The areas that could use improvement are to learn the most I can about the different embedded devices and microcontrollers available to integrate into a whole system. Learning which chips are best for a specific industry such as automotive or knowing which are best for home automation.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
State machines are so easy to understand now after going through this course and it's extremely valuable knowledge to develop and prototype a design for how software's complexity can be minimized into an actionable goal while being aware of design constraints or technological limitations such as limited memory or CPU computing power.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills from this project that will be particularly transferable to other projects and course work are the use of Python libraries to help prototype ideas for code that can later be written into a faster language such as Rust, C++ or C. Having a working prototype is the best way to learn and fail fast often. This problem solving technique is imperative towards becoming a great software engineer.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project is maintanable, readable and adaptable by using comments effectively and having a version control section. But learning how to use an already well documented library makes future use of the code easier to learn with the comments already created. This makes it easy for someone to understand immediately to grasp the details in an intuitive manner.
